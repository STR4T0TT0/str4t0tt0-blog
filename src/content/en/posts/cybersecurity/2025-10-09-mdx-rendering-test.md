# MDX Rendering Test (English)

This page helps you verify the **entire rendering pipeline**: headings, quotes, lists, code, tables, images, links, and task lists.  
If you can read everything below with proper **STR4T0TT0** typography and spacing, your MDX setup works.

## 1) Headings, emphasis & inline code

- **Bold**, *italic*, and `inlineCode()` should look consistent with your theme.
- Long paragraphs should wrap nicely and keep good line-height for readability.  
  This also checks your `prose-article` typography scales for English content.

### Example paragraph

Leaders face a flood of tools, acronyms, and best practices. Your blog should present **clear guidance**, actionable checklists, and opinionated takes.  
This paragraph is just filler text to ensure the page is long enough to validate scrolling and sticky elements in your layout.

## 2) Blockquote

> “Security is a process, not a product.”  
> — Bruce Schneier

## 3) Code fences

```ts
export function hash(input: string): string {
  // NOT a real hash — demo only
  return input.split('').reverse().join('');
}
console.log(hash("str4t0tt0"));
