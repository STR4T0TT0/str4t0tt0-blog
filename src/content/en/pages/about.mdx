#About#

I’m a senior IT Infrastructure Manager turned cybersecurity and AI enthusiast, exploring how emerging tech is reshaping our digital and financial landscapes.

Through concise insights and in-depth articles, I break down complex topics like blockchain, AI, and cyber risk into practical takeaways for decision-makers, tech professionals, and curious minds.

When I’m not writing, I am learning... My ultimate goal is to make technology clear, actionable, and a bit exciting.

You can follow my work here and connect with me on LinkedIn, Bluesky, and X/Twitter for more insights.
